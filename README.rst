Eggshell is part of the Birdhouse_ project. It is meant as a collection of utilities
for bird-house' WPS servers. It covers miscellaneous functionality like file handling
and common netCDF operations.

Eggshell was inspired by FlyingPigeon_, but we encourage developers to contribute their own code to eggshell
to make it one of the building blocks of climate related PyWPS services.
