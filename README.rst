Eggshell is meant as a collection of utilities for PyWPS_ servers.
It covers miscellaneous functionality like file handling and common netCDF operations.

Eggshell is part of the Birdhouse_ project.

Eggshell was inspired by FlyingPigeon_.
We encourage developers to contribute their own code to eggshell
